# OncoVAR
OncoVAR is a custom pipeline for detecting cancer-specific somatic mutations from matched tumor-normal NGS data. It uses samtools and bcftools for variant calling, benchmarks against Mutect2 and VarScan2, and validates findings with a reference gene list to ensure accurate identification of tumor-exclusive mutations.
